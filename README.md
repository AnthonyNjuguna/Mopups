Popups For MAUI 
---


Mopups is a replacement for the "Rg.Plugins.Popups" plugin for Xamarin. Mopups intends to provide a similar experience to this plugin, however also clean up the code base and provide forward looking enhancements. Developers familar with the original plugin should find it a smoooth transition, but we do recommend reading the wiki and reaching out with any issues.
